questions:
where does monkeytype store its wrong word?
why not use classList.add?
figure out how to let input active when clicking on the entire thing
the inputbox also moves with caret

Idea:
while in current word, use for loop to compare words to inputbox,
if words right continue, if wrong add error to word div, add current inputcontent to a list
then just to the next word. Remove content inside inputbox 

if space in inputbox, jump right to the next word.

if backspace in inputbox, detect if last word has error in its classlist, if not idgaf xD (event.inputType === "deleteContentBackward")
if yes put content back to inputbox from list then compare
